This are a some small projects we had to do in web engineering class at our university. 

I don't own any images located in those projects, so if you recognize a photo you have the rights of, please feel free to inform me. I'll add a link & name in the source-code :)
I too don't claim any rights for the images used. Everything is just for the purpose of being able to give an example on how the tasks could have been done.

I'll probably add and extend already existing README files of the projects so you can get more easily what the focus was on in the given project.
