v0.2.2 [git] - problem with BETA-buttons:
    - theme is getting applied accordingly to saved values
    - button reset -> button not set to read value (from save)
    - even though theme is set to 'sophisticated', button says 'main'
        -> theme after 'sophisticated' is 'eye-cancer' and not main again...


for design.js:
needed methods for 'Theme'- & 'Design'-classes:

    - get values from storage
        - put instantly into this.currentTheme?

    - set value (num) to storage
