This code is kinda messy. 
Probably going to code it again, but better.
It works mostly tho...

For adding items click the "+" then put in your data and click submit.
For deleting you click the "-" and click on the items you want to delete. Then again click "-".

The code should highlight tasks due in 1 day yellow, if I remember correctly, but it doesn't...
It should also highlight missed tasks red but it too does not do this :/

Yea, I guess I'm gonna code it again :D
