Notes:

- init -> LOOP (3-5 times): NEW_BUBBLE_FUNCTION();

- setIntervall( *NEW_BUBBLE_FUNCTION()* , RANDOM_TIME );            // RANDOM_TIME miliseconds between 3.5s and 7s

- BUBBLES: variable SIZE, TRANSPARENCY, COLOR
    - maybe make class with these attributes
    - everytime a bubble is spawned, an object is instantiated with randomized attributes

- Somehow get an onClick event on the bubble, so it can be 'destroyed'

- Graphical Objects -> CSS; no Canvas


get time tree !!!!
